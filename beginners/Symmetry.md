# Symmetry

Many of you are probably familiar with the concept of symmetry relatively straightforward. Let a line L be located on a plane and point A. Point B is called a symmetric point A with respect to line L if segment AB is perpendicular to line L and divided in half by the point of intersection with it. In particular, if point A lies on a line L, then point B coincides with point A.

Given a line L, parallel to one of the axes, and point A. Find a point B, symmetrical to A relative to L.

The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains 4 numbers: x1, y1, x2, y2 - coordinates of two different points through which the straight line L passes. The second line of the input file contains 2 numbers xA and yA - coordinates of point A. All numbers in the input file integers and do not exceed 108 in absolute value.

In the output file OUTPUT.TXT print the numbers xB and yB - the coordinates of point B.
