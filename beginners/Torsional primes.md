# Torsional primes
## Complexity 85%

Torsional primes are prime numbers which remain prime under all cyclic permutations of their digits.

For instance, the cyclic permutations of the number 3779 - 7793, 7937, 9377 are all prime numbers.

There are 13 such numbers below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.

Make a function torsional(n) that returns a list of all torsional prime numbers smaller than a given number n in ascending order.
