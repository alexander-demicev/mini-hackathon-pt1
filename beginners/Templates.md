# Templates

A pattern of size n is a string of length n, each of the characters of which is included in the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, ?}. Patterns are converted to strings from numbers by the following rules:

Two templates are given: p1 and p2. Consider the set of S1 lines that can be obtained from p1 by the described rules, and the set of S2 lines that can be obtained from p2. It is necessary to find the number of lines included in both of these sets.

The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains the pattern p1, the second - the pattern p2. Templates have the same positive size, not more than 9.

In the output file OUTPUT.TXT output the answer to the problem.
