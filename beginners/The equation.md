# The equation

Vasya at school studied quadratic equations and understood how they are easily solved by calculating the discriminant. But Petya told him about the method of solving cubic equations of the form A * X3 + B * X2 + C * X + D = 0. At the elective math option, Vasya was asked to solve about a hundred equations of precisely this type. But, unfortunately, Vasya forgot the formulas that Peter told him about. But Vasya was aware that all the roots of the equations are integers and are on the interval [-100, 100]. Therefore, Vasya has a chance to find them by brute force, but for this he will have to spend a lot of time, because it may be necessary to iterate over several thousand values. Help Vasya write a program that will help him find the roots of cubic equations!

The single line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains 4 numbers: A, B, C, and D are the integer coefficients of the cubic equation. Each modulus coefficient is less than 32768.

In a single line of the output file OUTPUT.TXT, you need to output all the roots of a given cubic equation in ascending order in ascending order. Multiple roots should be displayed only once.
