The emperor of the Milky Way galaxy decided to make an stocktaking of the roads on the planet Snowflake. But as it turned out, he is not good at math, so he asks you to count the number of roads. It is required to write a program that helps the emperor count the number of roads on the planet &quot;Snowflake&quot;.

INPUT The first line of the input file contains the number N (0 ≤ N ≤ 100). The next N lines contain N numbers, each of which is a single or zero. Moreover, if in the position (i, j) of a square matrix is ​​one, then the i-th and j-th cities are connected by roads, and if zero, they are not connected.

OUTPUT In the output file you need to display a number that determines the number of roads on the planet &quot;Snowflake&quot;.
