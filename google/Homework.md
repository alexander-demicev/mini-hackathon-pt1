# Homework

Petya does mathematics best in the class, so the teacher asked him a difficult homework, in which you need to find the sum of all positive elements in a given set of integers, then find where the maximum and minimum elements are in a given sequence and calculate the product of the numbers between them . It is also known that the minimum and maximum elements occur only once in a given set of numbers. Since the teacher gave Pete about 100 tasks of this kind, then Petya, as a strong programmer, was able to write a program that, according to a given set of numbers, finds its own solution. Are you weak?

The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains a single number N - the number of elements in the array. The second line contains N integers representing the given array. All array elements are separated by a space. Each of the numbers in the input file does not exceed 102 in absolute value.

In a single line of the output file OUTPUT.TXT, you need to output two numbers, separated by a space: the sum of the positive elements and the product of the numbers located between the minimum and maximum elements. The values ​​of the sum and product do not exceed the modulus 3 * 104.
