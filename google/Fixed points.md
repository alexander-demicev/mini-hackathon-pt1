# Fixed points

A permutation of P [1..n] of size n is a set of numbers from 1 to n arranged in a certain order. Moreover, each of these numbers must be present exactly once in it. Examples of permutations are 1,3,4,5,2 (for n = 5) and 3,2,1 (for n = 3), and, for example, 1,2,3,4,5,1 is not a permutation, since the number 1 occurs twice.

The number i is called a fixed point for the permutation P, if P [i] = i. For example, in the permutation 1,3,4,2,5 there are exactly two fixed points: 1 and 5, and the permutation 4,3,2,1 has no fixed points.

Given two numbers: n and k. Find the number of permutations of size n with exactly k fixed points.

The input file INPUT.TXT contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 9) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n).

In the output file OUTPUT.TXT output the answer to the problem.
