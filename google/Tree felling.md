# Tree felling

The king of Flatland decided to cut down some trees growing in front of his palace. The trees in front of the king&#39;s palace are planted in a row, there are only n trees growing there, the distances between neighboring trees are the same.

After cutting down, there must be m trees in front of the palace, and the distances between adjacent trees should be the same. Help the king figure out how many ways there are felling trees.

It is required to write a program that, given the given numbers n and m, will determine how many ways there are of cutting down some of the n trees so that, after cutting down, there are m trees and the neighboring trees are at an equal distance from each other.

The input file INPUT.TXT contains two integers n and m (0 ≤ m, n ≤ 1000).

In a single line of the output file OUTPUT.TXT need to output a single integer - the desired number of ways.

If we conventionally denote the initial location of the trees in front of the palace as &quot;TTTTT&quot;, then the possible results after cutting down are: &quot;TTT ..&quot;, &quot;.TTT.&quot;, &quot;..TTT&quot;, &quot;TTT&quot;.
