# Factorial
## Complexity 42%

It is required to calculate the factorial of the integer N. Factorial is designated as N! and calculated by the formula:

N! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * (N-1) * N, with 0! = 1.

The recurrence relation is also permissible: N! = (N-1)! * N

INPUT Contains a single non-negative integer number N (N &lt; 1000).

OUTPUT You need to output a single integer - the value of N!.
