# Factorial

It is required to calculate the factorial of the integer N. Factorial is designated as N! and calculated by the formula:

N! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * (N-1) * N, with 0! = 1.

The recurrence relation is also permissible: N! = (N-1)! * N

The single line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains a single non-negative integer number N (N &lt;1000).

In the output file OUTPUT.TXT you need to output a single integer - the value of N !.
