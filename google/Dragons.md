# Dragons

It is known that a dragon can have several heads and its strength is determined by the number of heads. But how to determine the power of the dragon pack, in which several dragons and each of them has a certain number of heads? You probably think that this value is calculated as the sum of all goals? Far from it, otherwise it would be too easy to calculate the power of the dragon pack. It turns out that the desired value is equal to the product of the number of goals for each of the dragons. For example, if in a troop there are 3 dragons with 3, 4, and 5 heads, respectively, then the force is 3 * 4 * 5 = 60. Suppose that we know the total value of the dragon pack heads, how we can calculate the maximum possible strength value of this dragon&#39;s lair ? This is the task you have to solve.

The single line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains a positive integer N (0 &lt;N &lt;100) - the number of heads of the dragon pack.

In the single line of the output file OUTPUT.TXT you need to display the maximum possible value of the force that a pack of dragons of N goals may have.
