There is almost no atmosphere on the planet “Auron”, so it is known for its temperature differences at various points. It is known that these fluctuations range from -100 to 100 degrees. Our specialists managed to find out the temperature values ​​at N points of this planet. Unfortunately, these values ​​are calculated with large errors, so they decided to round up to integers. I would like to visually see areas with high and low temperatures. You need help. You must arrange the temperature of the plots in non-decreasing order.

The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains a natural number N - the number of sections (N ≤ 106). The second line contains space-separated integer temperatures of these sections, not exceeding 100 in absolute value.

In a single line of the output file OUTPUT.TXT, you need to output the space-separated temperature values ​​of all known sections, which should follow each other in the non-decreasing order.
