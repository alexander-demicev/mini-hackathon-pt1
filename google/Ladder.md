# Ladder

A ladder is a set of cubes in which each upper layer contains cubes smaller than the previous one. It is required to write a program that calculates the number of ladders that can be constructed from N cubes.

The input file INPUT.TXT contains a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) - the number of cubes in the ladder.

In the output file OUTPUT.TXT you need to display the number of ladders that can be built from N cubes.
