INPUT contains a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) - the number of cubes in the ladder.

OUTPUT you need to display the number of ladders that can be built from N cubes.



| INPUT                             | OUTPUT                 |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| 3	                                | 2                      |
| 6	                                | 4                      |
