# Game 2

Do you like to play games? Of course, love! But about this game, perhaps, you know nothing and have not even heard. Well, tell about the new game. The board contains a sequence of n integers. Play two. On the next move, the player chooses a number from the right or left edge of the sequence, then this number is erased and the sequence becomes one less number, and the move goes to the opponent. Wins the one who collects in the amount of more. Write a program that determines the winner in a particular game, provided that the players play optimally.

The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains an integer n (0 &lt;n &lt;100). The second line contains space-separated n natural numbers not exceeding 1000.

In the single line of the output OUTPUT.TXT file, output 1 if the first player wins, 2 if the second player wins, and 0 if there is a draw.
