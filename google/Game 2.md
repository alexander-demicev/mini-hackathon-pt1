# Game 2
## Complexity 45%

Do you like to play games? Of course, you like! But about this game, perhaps, you know nothing and have not even heard. Well, we'll tell about the new game. The board contains a sequence of n integers. Two players. Every move, the player chooses a number from the right or left edge of the sequence, then this number is erased and the sequence becomes on one number smaller, and the move goes to the opponent. Wins the one whos summary will be bigger. Write a program that determines the winner in a particular game, players play optimally.

INPUT First line contains an integer n (0 &lt; n &lt; 100). The second line contains space-separated n natural numbers not exceeding 1000.

OUTPUT File, output 1 if the first player wins, 2 if the second player wins, and 0 if there is a draw.
