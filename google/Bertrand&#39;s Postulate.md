# Bertrand&#39;s Postulate

Bertrand&#39;s postulate (Bertrand-Chebyshev theorem, Chebyshev theorem) states that for any n&gt; 1 there is a prime number p in the interval n &lt;p &lt;2n. Such a hypothesis was put forward in 1845 by the French mathematician Joseph Bertrand (who tested it to n = 3,000,000) and was proved in 1850 by Pafnuti Chebyshev. Ramanuzhan in 1920 found simpler proof, and Erdös in 1932 - even simpler.

Your task is to solve a somewhat more general problem — namely, by the number n, find the number of prime numbers p from the interval n &lt;p &lt;2n.

Recall that a number is called simple if it is divisible only by itself and by one.

The input file INPUT.TXT contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50000).

In the output file OUTPUT.TXT output one number - the answer to the problem.
