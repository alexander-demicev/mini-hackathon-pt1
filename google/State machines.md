# State machines

Once a famous professor discovered the descriptions of k finite automata. In his opinion, the non-triviality of a finite automaton with n states and m transitions can be described by an integer d = 19m + (n + 239) * (n + 366) / 2. The more d, the more interesting for science is the study of its properties.

Help the professor to calculate the nontriviality of his machines.

The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10000) - the number of state machines. The next k lines contain two integers ni (0 ≤ ni ≤ 1000) and mi (0 ≤ mi ≤ 26ni2) - the number of states and transitions of the i-th automaton.

The output OUTPUT.TXT file must consist of k lines. On the i-th line of the output file output a single number - the nontriviality of the i-th machine.
