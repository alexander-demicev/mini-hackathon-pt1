# Strings

Cyclic shift of the string s is the string sksk + 1sk + 2 ... s | s | s1s2 ... sk-1 for some k, here | s | - string length s. A substring of the string s is the string sisi + 1 ... sj-1sj for some i and j. You are given two lines a and b. Output the number of substrings of the string a, which are cyclic shifts of the string b.

The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains the string a (1 ≤ | a | ≤ 1000). The second line of the input file contains the string b (1 ≤ | b | ≤ min (100, | a |)). Both strings consist only of English characters and numbers.

In the output file OUTPUT.TXT output an integer - the answer to the problem.
