# Two thugs

Thugs Harry and Larry were resting in nature. Having decided to shoot, they put on a log a few cans of Coca-Cola (no more than 10). Harry began to sweep the banks in order, starting with the most left, Larry - with the right. At some point it turned out that they simultaneously shot the same last can.

Harry was indignant and said that Larry owed him a lot of money for having deprived him of the pleasure of shooting several cans. In response, Larry said that Harry owes him even more money for the same reasons. They began to argue about who owes whom, but none of them remembered how many cans were in the beginning, and there was a reluctance to look for shot banks all over the district. Each of them remembered only how many cans he shot himself.
