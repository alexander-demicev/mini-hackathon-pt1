# Sawtooth sequence

The sequence a1, a2, a3, ..., an-1, an is called a sawtooth if it satisfies one of the following conditions:

Given a numeric sequence. It is required to determine the length of its longest continuous sawtooth subsequence.

The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains a positive integer N - the number of elements in the sequence. The second line of the file contains N space-separated integers {ai}. Limitations: N &lt;106, | ai | &lt;32,000.

In a single line of the output file OUTPUT.TXT need to output a single integer - the length of the longest continuous sawtooth subsequence.
