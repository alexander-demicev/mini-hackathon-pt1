# Field of Dreams

To play in the “Field of Miracles”, a round drum, divided into sectors, and an arrow are used. In each sector a number is recorded. In different sectors the same number can be written. Once the host of the game decided to change the rules. He himself began to rotate the drum and call the player (who did not see the drum) all the numbers in a row in the order in which the arrow pointed at them during the rotation of the drum. It turned out that the drum made a whole number of turns, that is, the last sector coincided with the first one. After that, the presenter asked the participant a question: what is the smallest number of sectors that can be on the drum? Required to write a program that answers this question leading.

The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains the number N - the number of numbers that the master called (2 ≤ N ≤ 30000). The second line contains N numbers indicated by the arrow in the process of drum rotation. The first number always coincides with the last (at the end the arrow points to the same sector as at the beginning). The numbers recorded in the drum sectors are natural, not exceeding 32,000.

In the output file OUTPUT.TXT you need to display one number - the minimum number of sectors that can be on the drum.
