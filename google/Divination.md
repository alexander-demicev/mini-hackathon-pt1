# Divination

Like many other girls, Masha loves various fortune telling. Some time ago, Masha learned a new way of guessing at numbers — for some natural number of interest n, we must calculate the sum of all numbers, into which n is divisible without remainder. Masha does not like arithmetic very much and asked you to write a program that automates the process of divination.

The single line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains a positive integer n (n ≤ 1000), which Masha was forced to report.

In the output file OUTPUT.TXT print the sum of all positive dividers of the number n.
