# Annual balance
## Complexity 35%

The "Blue Hat" company is calculating the annual balance. The accounting department received information that, according to the documents, the total expenses are A crowns, and the total income - B crowns. Since these numbers still have nothing to do with the real state of affairs, the accountant decided to implement his next idea. As you know, when typing numbers on a computer, people often enter numbers in the wrong order. Therefore, the accountant wants to find such a way to rearrange the digits in the numbers A and B, in a way that as a result the difference between A and B (the amount of money he puts in his pocket) is maximum, and in any case you can refer to the secretaryâ€™s mistake. We must not forget about the sign of numbers and that zero cannot be the first digit of a number other than zero. Write a program that will help the accountant.

INPUT contains two integers a and b (-109 < a, b < 109).

OUTPUT print a single integer - the largest difference of numbers, the first one can be obtained by rearranging the digits A, and the second - by rearranging the digits B.

| INPUT                             | OUTPUT                 |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| 18 10                             | 71                     |
| 1 -23                             | 33                     |
