# Queen, rook and knight

On the 8x8 chessboard there are three figures: a queen, a rook and a knight. It is required to determine the number of empty board fields that are under combat. For simplicity, we will assume that figures can “beat” through other figures. For example, in the situation considered on the right, we will assume that the queen beats D5 through the rook.

In the single line of the input file INPUT.TXT, the coordinates of the location of three figures are written through the space: queen, rook, and knight, respectively. Each coordinate consists of one English character (from A to H) and one digit (from 1 to 8).

In the output file OUTPUT.TXT you need to display the number of empty fields that beat the figures specified in the input data.
