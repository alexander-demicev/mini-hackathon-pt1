# Bunny

A hare appeared in our zoo. He was placed in a cage, and so that he was not bored, the director of the zoo ordered to put a ladder in his cage. Now our bunny can jump up the ladder, jumping over the steps. A ladder has a certain number of steps N. A hare can overcome in no more than K steps in one leap. For a change, the bunny is trying every time to find a new path to the top of the stairs. The director is curious how many different ways the rabbit has to get to the top of the stairs for given values ​​of K and N. Help the director to write a program that will help to calculate this number. For example, if K = 3 and N = 4, then there are the following routes: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 2, 1 + 2 + 1, 2 + 1 + 1, 2 + 2, 1 + 3, 3 + 1. Those. at given values, the hare has only 7 different routes to the top of the stairs.

The single line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains two natural numbers K and N (1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 300). K is the maximum number of steps that the hare can overcome in one jump, N is the total number of stairs.

In the single line of the output OUTPUT.TXT file, you need to output the number of possible options for different hare routes to the top rung of the ladder without leading zeros.
