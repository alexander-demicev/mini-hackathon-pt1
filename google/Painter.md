# Painter

A famous artist decided to write a new masterpiece. After many days of hard work, he wanted to explore his creation. The artist remembered that the picture was written as follows: first, a white canvas was taken, having the shape of a rectangle of width w and height h. Then the artist painted on this canvas n rectangles with sides parallel to the sides of the canvas and vertices arranged in integer coordinates. Help the artist to determine the area of ​​the unpainted part of the canvas.

The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains two positive integers w and h (1 ≤ w, h ≤ 100). The second line contains an integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 5000) - the number of rectangles. The following n lines contain information about all the rectangles. Each line describes one rectangle in the form of four numbers x1, y1, x2, y2, where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the upper left and right lower corners of the rectangle, respectively.

Output in the output file OUTPUT.TXT one integer - the area of ​​the empty part of the canvas.
