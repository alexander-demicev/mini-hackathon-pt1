# Hairy business

One neformal was kicked out of work, and now he needs to somehow earn a living. Upon reflection, he decided that he could have very good money selling his own hair. It is known that reception centers buy hair of arbitrary length costing CU for every centimeter. Since the hair market is very dynamic, the price of one centimeter of hair changes every day as well as the exchange rate. Neformal is a very good business analyst. He was able to calculate what the price of one centimeter of hair would be in each of the next N days (for convenience, we will enumerate the days in chronological order from 0 to N-1). Now he wants to determine which of these days he should sell his hair in order to earn the maximum amount of money after all N days. Note that the hair of the Neformal grow only at night and grow to 1 centimeter per night. It should also be noted that before the 0th day, the neformal with a grief had his hair trimmed and by the 0th day the length of his hair was 1 centimeter.

The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains an integer N (0 &lt;N â‰¤ 100). The second line contains N space-separated natural numbers not exceeding 100, corresponding to a C [i] 1 centimeter value of hair for each i-th day.

In the single line of the output file OUTPUT.TXT you need to output the maximum amount of money that non-formal can earn in N days.
