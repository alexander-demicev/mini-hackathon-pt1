Masha loves various fortune telling. Some time ago, Masha learned a new way of guessing at numbers — for some natural number n, we need to calculate the sum of all numbers, into which n is divisible without remainder. Masha does not like arithmetic very much and asked you to write a program that automates the process of divination.

INPUT contains a positive integer n (n ≤ 1000).

OUTPUT print the sum of all positive dividers of the number n.


| INPUT                             | OUTPUT                 |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| 6	                                | 12                     |
| 10		                            | 18                     |
