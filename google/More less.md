One of the main operations with numbers is their comparison. We suspect that you are fluent in this operation and can compare any numbers. In this problem, you need to compare two integers.

INPUT The two lines of the input file contain the numbers A and B, not exceeding in absolute value 2 × 109.

OUTPUT Write in the output file one character “&lt;”, if A &lt; B, “&gt;”, if A &gt; B and “=”, if A = B.


| INPUT                             | OUTPUT                 |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| 5<br>7                            | &lt;                   |
| -7<br>-12                         | &gt;                   |
