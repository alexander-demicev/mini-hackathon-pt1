# Two circles

Two circles are given on the plane. It is required to check whether they intersect.

The input file INPUT.TXT consists of two lines. Each line contains information about a single circle - the coordinates of its center x and y (integers that do not exceed 5000 in absolute value) and radius (integer 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000).

In the output file OUTPUT.TXT output &quot;YES&quot;, if the circles intersect, and &quot;NO&quot; otherwise.
