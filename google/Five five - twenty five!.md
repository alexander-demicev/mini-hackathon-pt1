# Five five - twenty five!

Vasya and Petya study in the same class at school. Recently, Petya told Vasya about a clever method of squaring natural numbers ending in figure 5. Now Vasya can easily square two-digit (and even some three-digit) numbers ending in 5. The method is as follows: for squaring a number, ending with 5, it is enough to multiply the number obtained from the original one by crossing out the last five by the next number in order, then all that remains is to add “25” to the resulting result to the right. For example, in order to build the number 125 in a square, it suffices to multiply 12 by 13 and add 25, i.e. attributing to the number 12 * 13 = 156 the number 25, we get the result 15625, i.e. 1252 = 15625. Write the program, raising the number ending in 5, in the square so that Vasya could test his skills.

The single line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains one positive integer A, ending in a number 5, not exceeding 4 * 105.

In the output file OUTPUT.TXT output one positive integer - A2 without leading zeros.
