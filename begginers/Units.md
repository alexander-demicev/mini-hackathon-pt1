# Units

In computer science lessons, you were probably taught to transfer numbers from one number system to another and perform other similar operations. It&#39;s time to demonstrate this knowledge. Find the number of units in the binary notation of the given number.

The input file INPUT.TXT contains the integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 109).

In a single line of the output file OUTPUT.TXT you need to output one integer - the number of binary ones in the record of the number n.
