# Homework
## Complexity 27%

Petya does mathematics best in the class, so the teacher gave him a difficult homework, where he needs to find the sum of all positive elements in a given set of integers, then find where the maximum and minimum elements are in a given sequence and multiply numbers between them. It is also known that the minimum and maximum elements occur only once in a given set of numbers. Since the teacher gave Pete about 100 tasks of this kind, Petya, as a strong programmer, was able to write a program that, can you also do it?

INPUT contains a single number N - the number of elements in the array, you may not need it, depends on your implementation. The second line contains N integers representing the given array.

TXT two numbers, separated by a space: the sum of the positive elements and the product of the numbers located between the minimum and maximum elements.

| INPUT                             | OUTPUT                      |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| N=5 [-7 5 -1 3 9]                 | 17 -15                      |
| N=8 [3 14 -9 4 -5 1 -12 4]	      | 26 180                      |
| N=10 [-5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 -3]	    | 36 5040                     |
