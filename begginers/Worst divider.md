# Worst divider

We say that the number a is better than the number b if the sum of digits a is greater than the sum of digits of number b, and in the case of equality of the sums of their digits if the number a is less than the number b. For example, the number 124 is better than the number 123, since the first one has the sum of seven digits, and the second six. Also, the number 3 is better than the number 111, since they have the same sum of numbers, but the first one is smaller.

Given the number n. Find such its divisor d (the number n and the unit itself are considered divisors of the number n) that any other divisor c of the number n is better than d.

The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105000).

In the output file OUTPUT.TXT output the answer to the problem.
