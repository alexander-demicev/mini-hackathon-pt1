# Bertrand&#39;s Postulate
## Complexity 30%

Bertrand&#39;s postulate (Bertrand-Chebyshev theorem, Chebyshev theorem) states that for any n &gt; 1 there is a prime number p in interval n &lt; p &lt; 2n. Such a hypothesis was put forward in year 1845 by the French mathematician Joseph Bertrand (who tested it to n = 3,000,000) and was proved in year 1850 by Pafnuti Chebyshev. Ramanuzhan in year 1920 found simpler proof, and Erdös in year 1932 - even more simpler.

Your task is to solve a more general problem. Find the number of prime numbers p from the interval n &lt; p &lt; 2n by the number n.

We want to remind you that a number is called prime if it is divisible only by itself and by one.

INPUT Contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50000).

OUTPUT Output one number - the answer to the problem.
