Artist remembered that picture was written as follows: first, was taken by a white canvas in the shape of a rectangle of width w and height h. Subsequently, the artist painted this canvas n rectangles with parallel sides and canvas tops located at integer coordinates.
Help the artist to determine the size of the canvas unpainted.

The first line of the input file INPUT. TXT contains two natural numbers w and h (1 ≤ w, h ≤ 100). In the second line recorded an integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 5000)-the number of rectangles. Next n lines contain information about all the rectangles. Each row describes one rectangle in form four numbers x 1, y1, x 2, y2 where (x 1, y1) and (x 2, y2) is the coordinates of the top left and lower-right corner of the rectangle, respectively.

Disable OUTPUT to the output file. TXT one integer is the area of the canvas unpainted.
