# Field of miracles

For playing "field of wonders" is used round drum, divided into sectors, and arrow. In each sector recorded a number. In various sectors can be written to the same number.
Once a leading games decided to change the rules. He became drum and rotate to call the player (which drum not seen) all numbers in a row, in the order in which the arrow is pointing at them during rotation of the drum. It so happened that the drum did a whole number of revolutions, that is the last sector coincided with the first.
After that, a leading party asked the question: what is the smallest number of sectors may be on a drum? 
You want to write a program that responds to this question.

In the first line of the input file INPUT. TXT recorded number N is the number of numbers that called leading (2 ≤ N ≤ 30000). In the second line of the recorded numbers, on which point the arrow during rotation of the drum. The first number is always the same as the last (at the end of the arrow is pointing to the same sector, as in the beginning). The number of recorded drum-natural sectors, not in excess of 32000.

In the output file OUTPUT. TXT to list one number-the minimum number of sectors that can be on the drum.
