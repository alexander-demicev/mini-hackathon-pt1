# Dragons

It is known that the Dragon could be several goals and its strength is determined by the number of goals. But how to determine the force's flocks in which several dragons and each of them has a certain number of goals? You probably think that this value is calculated as the sum of all goals? Far from it, otherwise it would be too easy to calculate the force's flocks. It turns out that the value is equal to the product of the values of the number of goals each of the Dragons. For example, if a 3 Pack Dragon, whose 3, 4 and 5 goals respectively, then the force is equal to 3 * 4 * 5 = 60. For example, suppose we know the total value of goals as we flock's calculate the maximum possible value of this den of dragons? It is precisely this task and you have to solve it.

In a single line of input file INPUT. TXT recorded natural number N (0 < N < 100)-number of goals's flocks. 

In a single row output file OUTPUT. TXT FILE you want to display the maximum possible value of the force, which can have swarms of dragons from N.
