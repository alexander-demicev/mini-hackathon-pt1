# String

Cyclic shift of s is called a string were + 1sk +2 ... s | s | s1s2 ... sk-1 for some k, here | s | -the length of the string s. Substring of a string s is called a string of sisi +1. sj-1sj for some i and j. you are given two lines a and b. output the number of substrings of the string a, are cyclical shift line b. 

The first line of the input file INPUT. TXT contains a string (1 ≤ | a | ≤ 1000). In the second line of the input file is written line b (1 ≤ | b | ≤ min (100, | a |)). Both lines consist only of characters from the English alphabet and digits.

In the output file OUTPUT. TXT display an integer on a task.
