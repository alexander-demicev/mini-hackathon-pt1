# Chess


Most recently, Joe took up programming and decided to implement its own program for playing chess. But there was a problem determining the progress of a horse, which makes the user. I.e. If you enter value "C7-D5", then the program should identify it as a correct move, if you typed "E2-E4", you wrong. Just need to check the correctness of the entries: for example, if you typed "D9-N5, the program must define the entry as erroneous. Help him to carry out this check!

In a single line of input file INPUT. TXT recorded text (nonempty string), which is indicated by the user. The user cannot enter a string that is longer than 5 characters.

In the output file OUTPUT. TXT to display YES if specified ratsuk faithful, if an entry is valid (in the sense of correctness coordinate entry), but progress is not possible, you must display a "NO". If the coordinates are not defined or specified incorrectly, the display "ERROR" message.
