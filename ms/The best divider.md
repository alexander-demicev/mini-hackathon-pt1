# The best divider

We say that a better number (b) if the amount of digits (a) is greater than the sum of the digits of b, and in case of the equal amounts if the number of digits in a number (b). For example, the number of 124 better number 123 as the first sum of digits equals seven and the second is six. Also, the number 3 number 111 is better, because they are equal to the sum of the digits, but the first of them less.

An integer n that locate the divisor (the number n and unit are considered to be divisors of n), which is better than any other the divisor of n.

The first line of the input file contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).

In the output file, display the response to the task.
