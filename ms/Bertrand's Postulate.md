# Bertrand's Postulate

Bertrand's postulate (Bertrand's theorem-Chebyshev theorem, Chebyshev) States that for any n there is simple number 1 > p in the interval n < p < 2n. This hypothesis was put forward in the year 1845 French mathematician Bertrand Dzhozefem (it's up to n = 3000000) and proven in 1850 year Colossus, Pafnutiem. Ramanuzhan in 1920 year, found a simpler proof, and Erdös in 1932 is even more simple.

Your task is to solve a few of the more common objective-namely the number n to find the number of primes p of n interval < p < 2n.

Recall that the number is called simple if it is divisible only by itself and one.

Input file INPUT. TXT contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50000).
