# Sawtooth sequence

A sequence a1, a2, a3, ..., an-1, an is called a sawtooth if it meets any one of the following conditions is true:

Given a numeric sequence. You want to determine the length of the longest its sawtooth continuous subsequence.

In the first line of the input file INPUT. TXT recorded natural number N is the number of elements in the sequence. In the second line of the file through the gap recorded N elements of the integer sequences {ai}. Limitations: N 106, ai < | | < 32000. 


In a single row output file OUTPUT. TXT FILE you want to display a single integer-length the length of the continuous sawtooth subsequence.
