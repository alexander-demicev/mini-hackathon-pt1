# Game

In his spare time, classmates Joe and Peter love to play various puzzle games: battleship, Tic-Tac-Toe, chess, checkers, and more. Guys have done it and played in all sorts of classic games of this kind, including computer. Once they wanted to play something new, but you were looking for could not be found. Then Peter came up with the following game "Guessing": played by two actors. The first makes any three-digit number, such that the first and last digits differ by more than 1. Next zagadavshij the number the player flips the hidden number, changing the first and last digits reversed, so getting another number. Then from the maximum of the two numbers is subtracted the minimum. The second task of the player is to guess on the first digit derived from subtracting the number this number itself.
For example, if Joe made number 487, the permutation of the first and last numbers he will receive the number of 784. Then he will have to subtract from the number 784 487, bringing the number of 297 which will turn and must guess petya on specified the first digit "2" taken from this number.
Peter manages to better Vasi on mathematics, so almost always wins in games of this type. But in this case Peter cheated and specially invented a game in which he will not lose Vasya anyway. The fact of the matter is that by Petya game has a winning strategy as follows: original number is always three and the second digit is always equal to nine and to retrieve the value of the last enough to take away from the nine first, i.e. described above, if the last digit is 9-2 = 7.
Help Pete even simplify the process of guessing the number for a given its first digit by writing the appropriate program.

In a single line of input file INPUT. TXT is specified only the figure corresponding to the first digit They received by subtracting the smallest hidden Vasya values from most.

In the output file OUTPUT. TXT FILE you want to display the value They received the difference.
