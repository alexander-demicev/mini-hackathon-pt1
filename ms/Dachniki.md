# Dachniki

Everyone knows that summer-the people strange, almost the same as programmers. They built their villas wonder where, and it's unclear that there are grown and wonder why. And how they get there is another story: someone on the bus who train, who on the car, well, someone does walk goes from home to the plot. So don't be surprised if you suddenly learn that some Horticultural Association is located on the island, and summer visitors get to him. And even on this island may not be a runway, so that the land on the island can only be jumping with a parachute (we really do not see how they come back with dachas home). Let's take a look at this unique event. The pilot always tries to disembark the troopers so that vacationers have landed as close as possible to their rectangular areas. Pilot wondered: how many truckers will land on their sites? 
Help him solve this problem!

In the first line of the input file INPUT. TXT recorded natural number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000)-the number of truckers, followed by N rows, each of which describes the coordinates of each city founders introduced and its plot: X Y X 1 Y1 X 2 Y2 X 3 Y3 X 4 Y4 where (X, Y) co-ordinates the parachuter landing (x 1, Y1, x 2, , Y2, X 3, Y3, x 4, Y4)-the coordinates of the rectangular area on a plane, these consistently.
All the coordinates are integers not exceeding 50000 in absolute value

In the output file OUTPUT. TXT FILE you want to display the number of truckers, which landed on your site. Hit on the border of the plot is considered a hit.
