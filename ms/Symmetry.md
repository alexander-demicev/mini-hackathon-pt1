# Symmetry

Many of you are probably familiar with the concept of symmetry with respect to direct. Let him on the plane, you will find direct L and point a. Point B is symmetric point on A relatively straight line L, if the segment AB is perpendicular to the straight line L and point of intersection is divided in half with it. In particular, if a point lies on a straight line L, then point B coincides with the point a.

Configure direct parallel to L, one of the coordinate axes and point a. Locate the point in, symmetrical and relatively (L).

The first line of the input file INPUT. TXT contains 4 numbers: x 1, y1, x 2, y2 are the coordinates of the two different points through which passes straight l. the second line of the input file contains 2 xA and yA-coordinates all number in the input file and do not exceed 108 modulo.


In the output file OUTPUT. TXT display number of xB and yB-coordinates of a point (B).
