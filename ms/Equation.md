# Equation

Joe studied at school quadratic equations and understood, as they are easily solved by calculating the discriminant. But Peter told him about the method for solving cubic equations A * X 3 + B * x 2 + C * X + D = 0. In the course of mathematics was asked about 100 solve Vaasa equations just this kind. But, unfortunately, Joe forgot the formula, which told him Peter. But Vasya was aware that all the roots of equations are integers and are in the interval [-100, 100]. So John's have a chance to find their brute-force attack, but he will have to spend a lot of time, as possibly will have to iterate through thousands of values. Help the Person to write a program that will help him to find the roots of the cubic equations!

In a single line of input file INPUT. TXT 4 numbers are recorded: (A), (B), (C) and (D) entire coefficients of cubic equations. Each coefficient magnitude less than 32768.

In a single row output file OUTPUT. TXT to display through a gap in the ascending order of all roots of a specified cubic equations. Multiple roots should display only once.
