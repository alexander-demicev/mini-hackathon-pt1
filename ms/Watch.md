Peter likes to observe the electronic clock. He spent days staring at the clock and thought, how many times each digit occurs. A few months later, he learned to talk while any number of times on the clock during this time meet each digit, and very proud of it.

Joe decided to check Peter, but he doesn't know how to do it. Joe asked you to help him. Write a program, a crucial task.

The first and second lines of the input file INPUT. TXT contains the beginning and end of a period of time, respectively. Start time does not exceed the target. Time is specified in the format hh: mm: ss (0 ≤ hh, 0 ≤ 24 < mm, 0 ≤ 60 < ss < 60). HH, mm, ss complemented by leading zeros up to two characters. These zeros are also taken into account when counting the number of digits.

Output file OUTPUT. TXT must contain 10 rows. In the i-th row must be written, how many times meets i-figure 1.
