# Bunny

In our Zoo has started a Hare. He was placed in a cage, and that he was not bored, Zoo Director ordered to put in his cage ladder. Now our Bunny can jump on the ladder up, jumping over the step. The ladder has a certain number of steps N. Hare could not overcome one bound over to the stairs. For diversity Bunny tries each time to find a new path to the top of the stairs. The Director of the curious, how many different ways there are hares reach the top of the stairs with specified values of K and N Help the Director to write a program that will help you calculate this amount.
For example, if K = 3 and N = 4, there are the following routes: 1 +1 +1 +1, +1 +2 1, +2 1, +1 2 +1 +1, 2 +2, 1 +3, 3 +1. I.e. data values of the Hare only 7 different routes to reach the top of the stairs.

In a single line of input file INPUT. TXT recorded two natural numbers N and K (1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 300). The maximum number of steps, which can overcome the Bunny one jump, N is the total number of steps of the staircase.

In a single row output file OUTPUT. TXT FILE you want to display the number of possible choices of different routes to the top rung of the ladder the Hare without leading zeros.
