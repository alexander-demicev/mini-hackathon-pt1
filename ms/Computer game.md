# Computer game

You can remember at least one of his acquaintances before 20 years of age, who as a child not playing computer games? If Yes, then maybe you are not familiar with this fun? However, difficulties in this task is to create.

In many older games with 2D graphics, you may encounter such a situation. Any hero jumping on the platforms (or Islands) that hang in the air. It must move from one edge to the other. The jump from one platform to the next, the hero escapes | y2-y1 | units of energy, where y1 and y2 is the height at which the platform. In addition, the hero is superpriem, which allows you to skip through the platform, but it takes 3 * | y3-y1 | units of energy. Of course, energy should be spent sparingly.

Suppose you know the coordinates of all the platforms in order from left edge to the right. If you can find, what is the minimum amount of energy required to get the hero from the first platform to the latest?

In the first line of the input file INPUT. TXT recorded number of platforms n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30000). The second line contains n natural numbers not exceeding 30000-height platform are.

In the output file OUTPUT. TXT record singular-a minimal amount of energy which the player must spend to overcome platform (of course assuming that cheat codes cannot be used).
