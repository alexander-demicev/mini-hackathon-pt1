# Secret message

At a secret base in the Arctic received encryption-a sequence of n digits. It contains the number of the secret base in Antarctica, which is a sequence of k digits. In doing so, in order to distinguish it from unnecessary information to you, he repeated in encrypt at least twice (perhaps these two occurrences overlap).

Write a program which encrypt and length of rooms classified base determines whether encryption number base. Note that the base may be a few numbers and they can all be transferred to encrypt.

The first line of the input file INPUT. Txt file contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 5)-length of encryption and the length of the secret base rooms respectively. The second line contains n digits is encryption. Remember that the numbers in the encrypt is not separated by a space.

In the output file OUTPUT. TXT display YES if encoding contains the number of the secret base, and NO otherwise.
