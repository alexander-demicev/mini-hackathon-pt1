"On the planet Auron» atmosphere is almost non-existent, so it is known for its differences of temperatures at various points. It is known that these swings ranged from 100 to-100 degrees. Our specialists able to determine values of temperatures in N points of this planet. Unfortunately, these values are calculated with large errors, so they decided to round up to whole numbers. I would like to see evidence of plots with high and low temperature. You need help. You must arrange the temperature sites on neubyvaniju.

In the first line of the input file INPUT. TXT is set to a positive integer N is the number of plots (N ≤ 106). In the second line through the gap recorded integer values of temperatures of these sites does not exceed 100 in absolute value.

In a single row output file OUTPUT. TXT you want separated by a space temperatures for all known sites, which must follow each other in the order neubyvanija.
