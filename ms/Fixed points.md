# Fixed points

Permutation (P) [1 .. n] n is a set of numbers from 1 to n, arranged in a certain order. It must be present exactly once each of these numbers. Examples of permutations are 1, 3, 4, 5, 2 (n = 5) and 3, 2, 1 (n = 3), and, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1 permutation is not, as the number 1 occurs twice.

The number i called fixed point for permutation P if P [i] = i; for example, rearrangement of 1, 3, 4, 2, 5 exactly two fixed points: 1 and 5, and rearrangement of 4, 3, 2, 1 has no fixed points.

Given two numbers n and k. find the number of permutations of n with exactly k fixed points.

Input file INPUT. Txt file contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 9) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n).

In the output file OUTPUT. TXT display the response to the task.
