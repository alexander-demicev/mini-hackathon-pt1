# Hairy business

One-neformala kicked out from work, and now he had to somehow earn a living. On reflection, he decided that he could have a very good money by selling your own hair. It is known that receiving sites buy hair any length value from USD for every inch. Because hair is a very dynamic market, the price of one centimetre of hair changes every day as the exchange rate. Guy is a very good business analyst. He was able to calculate what will be the price of one centimetre of hair in each of the next N days (for convenience, enumerate the days in chronological order from 0 to N-1). Now he wants to determine which of these days it should sell the hair to after every N days earn the maximum amount of money. Note that neformala hair grow only at night and grow to 1 centimeter per night. It should be noted that prior to the 0-th day guy with grief and shaved concedes 0-day length of his hair was 1 centimeter.
