# Compact operator

The operator and operating from a variety x to a set Y (or simply operator from X to Y) is the rule that each element x of a multitude of X is mapped to an element y = Ax from many Y. Let X and Y is the set of points on the plane. A statement from X to Y is called a contraction with a coefficient of q, where q is a real number from poluintervala [0, 1) If for any x from X solved | AX | ≤ q * | x | (here | x | -norm of point x is the distance from x to the origin). Simply put, the operator called the contraction by a factor q If it maps each point a point which is not less than q times closer to the origin.

For a given operator and you want to check whether it is pressure by a factor q.

The first line of the input file INPUT. TXT contains a number of points n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and q (0 ≤ q < 1) specified with no more than 3 digits after the decimal point. Next n lines contain 4 integers modulo not exceeding 1000, separated by spaces-many point coordinates X and mapped the points from the set Y.

In the output file OUTPUT. TXT display one word: "Yes" If the operator is a contraction with a coefficient of q and a "No" otherwise.
