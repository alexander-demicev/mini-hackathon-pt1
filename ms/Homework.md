# Homework

Peter manages to math better than anyone in the class, so the teacher asked him complicated homework that you want in the given set of integers find the sum of all the positive elements, then find where in the specified sequence are maximum and minimum element and compute the product of numbers located between them. Just know that the minimum and maximum item found in a specified set of numbers only once. Since the objectives of this kind of teacher gave Pete a hundred, Peter as a strong programmer could write a program that, given a set of numbers alone finds a solution. Did you poorly?

In the first line of the input file INPUT. TXT recorded a single number N is the number of elements in the array. The second line contains N integers representing the specified array. All array elements are separated by a space. Each of the numbers in the input file does not exceed 102 in absolute value.

In a single row output file OUTPUT. TXT FILE you want to display two numbers, separated by a space: the sum of the positive elements and the product numbers that are between the minimum and maximum elements. Value amount and works do not exceed modulo 3 * 104.
