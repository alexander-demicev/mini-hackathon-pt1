# Divination

Like many other girls, Masha likes different divination. Some time ago Masha has learned a new way to speculate on numbers-for any natural number n it interest it is necessary to calculate the sum of all the numbers that divides n without remainder. Masha loves not arithmetic, and asked you to write a program that automates the process of divination.

In a single line of input file INPUT. TXT recorded natural number n (n â‰¤ 1000), that Masha was forced to announce.

In the output file OUTPUT. TXT output the sum of all natural numbers n dividers.
