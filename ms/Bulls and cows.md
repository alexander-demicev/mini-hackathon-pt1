Every time Joe offers its version number, and Petya makes Vasya hint: reports the number of bulls and cows, followed by Vasja given clues continues to otgadyvanie number until you guess. Bulls is the number of digits in the number, They proposed matching by value and standing in the correct position in relation of Petya. Cows-number of digits have the same value but are in the wrong position. For example, if the number of planned Pete 5671, and Vasya suggested 7251, the number of bulls is equal to 1 (only 1 digit in its place), and the number of cows is equal to 2 (only numbers 5 and 7 are not in their seats). Peter is good at math, but even he might be wrong. Help Pete write a program that would zagadannomu Petya and proposed They numbers reported the number of bulls and cows.
