# Worst divisor

We say that a better number (b) if the amount of digits (a) is greater than the sum of the digits of b, and in case of the equal amounts if the number of digits in a number (b). For example, the number of 124 better number 123 as the first sum of digits equals seven and the second is six. Also, the number 3 number 111 is better, because they are equal to the sum of the digits, but the first of them less.

An integer n that locate divisor d (the number n and unit are considered to be divisors of n) that any other divider (c) the number n is better than d.

The first line of the input file INPUT. TXT contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105000).


In the output file OUTPUT. TXT display the response to the task.
