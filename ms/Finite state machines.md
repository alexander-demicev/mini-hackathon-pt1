# Finite state machines

Once known the Professor discovered k description of finite state machines. In his view, the nontriviality of the state machine that has n States and transitions can be described with m an integer d = 19 m + (n + 239) * (n + 366)/2. The more (d), the greater the interest for science is the study of its properties.

Help Professor compute nontrivial existing machines.

The first line of the input file INPUT. TXT contains an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10000)-number of finite state machines. The following k rows contain two integers ni (0 ≤ ni ≤ 1000) and mi (0 ≤ 26ni2 ≤ mi) is the number of States and transitions of the 1st machine.

Output file OUTPUT. TXT should consist of k rows. At the i-th row of the output file display one number-the nontriviality of the 1st machine.
